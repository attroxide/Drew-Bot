# Drew-Bot

Drew Bot is an assistant that I am working on, previously known as BMO Bot I have rebranded the name and, if you are reading this, decided to open source.

Note:
If you are using this code for your own project then you must mention either my github or my youtube.
If you find a bug or want to add something to the project then send a pull request :)

IMPORTANT:
Open Sourcing this
Very broken version at the moment, the updater is broken and thus not alot of the code works anymore
Have no intention to fix this as I've lost motivation for the projects, if anybody wants to finish this as you can see it has alot of planned features feel free to contact me
